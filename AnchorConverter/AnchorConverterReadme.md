# AnchorConverter

Asuming you propably will **ask why i need this**.  
So the answer is because the anchors gives you good scaling interface with resoultion.
Converter manipulate the anchors based on width and height object. With simply bind option it boost up creation process with of course a good practice of making ui. 

How to use: 
## Step 1: Create element UI
Object must be a rect transform (e.g. button, image etc.)

Currently anchors are in the middle of the target, ye anchors are the 4 white triangles. 

## Step 2: Select object in hierarchy
