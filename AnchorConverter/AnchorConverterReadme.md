AnchorConverter

Why i need this ?
Asuming you propably will ask why i need this. 
So the answer is because thanks for anchors gives you good scaling interface with resoultion.

Converter manipulate the anchors based on width and height object. With simply bind option it boost up creation process with of course a good practice making ui. 

How to use: 
1. Create ui element, it must be a rect transform (e.g. button, image etc.)

Currently anchors are in the middle of the target, ye anchors are the 4 white triangles. 

2. Select the object in the hierarchy
